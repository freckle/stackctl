stackctl-ls(1) - list stack specifications
==========================================

## SYNOPSIS

`stackctl ls`

## DESCRIPTION

This command locates `stacks/` for the currently-authorized AWS Account and
Region and lists them.

The key differences between this and stackctl-cat(1) is that this command lists
things as simple rows and indicates for each spec if a deployed stack exists in
the first column.

## OPTIONS

None.
